JUMPREAL is an academic prototype. This project is a perfectly running and functional platform 3D project. 

The player has lifebar, can move around and jump, cannons shoot cannonballs that damage the player, and hearts can restore player's health. 
The objective is to collect all the coins in the stage and then reach the flag. 
If player's health reachs zero or falls from the platforms, the level and coins collected are restarted.
